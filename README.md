 # Budget Tracker 
 
 ## Description
 
* Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. 
* Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.
* This project will update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. 
* If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. 
* Once these changes have been made the application will be deployed to Heroku.
